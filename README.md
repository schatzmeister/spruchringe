# Spruchringe

This repository is my personal aphorism collection: Here I gather all my
smart (and not so smart – mostly not so smart) adages. Naturally, almost
everything is in German, since that is my native language.


Not everything written down in this file reflects my actual views. In
particular, the older aphorisms do not align with my current world view
anymore, and some probably never did.


The name of the repository is, as one should expect, a wordplay on the
the German word “spruchreif”.

## Technical Notes

The repository consists mainly of one single file containing everything
I’m willing to publish. But, since I also collect sentences which should
not (yet) be published, there is one additional file with all the ideas
and contexts (which is kept private), and a simple script stripping this
document of all the non-noteworthy stuff.
