# Spruchringe

This repository is my personal aphorism collection: Here I gather all my
smart (and not so smart – mostly not so smart) adages. Naturally, almost
everything is in German, since that is my native language.


The repository consists mainly of one single file containing everything
I’m willing to publish. But, since I also collect sentences which should
not (yet) be published, there is one additional file with all the ideas
and contexts, and a simple script stripping this document of all the non-
noteworthy stuff which is run via a git hook before commiting.


The name of the repository is, as one should expect, a wordplay on the
the German word “spruchreif”.
